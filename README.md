## What I Found Interesting About the Article

The article's title caught my attention at first sight. The author uses many
anecdotes to illustrate his perspectives and as a tool to make readers laugh.
It is a funny piece to read while providing a sharp point of view on the software
engineering industry at the same time. The article has a strong individualistic voice.
You can feel the author's humor and personality through his words, as if you were his
friend. He narrows the macro-problem of a depressed market into small details and
stories. I enjoyed the article overall.
